        <h2>Everglean</h2>
        <h3>By: Harper Lu</h3>
        <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>
        “Hello! My name is Harper! Welcome to my world of magic, Everglean! This story is based on my favorite book, Keeper of the Lost Cities! The name, Everglean, was the main character’s (Sophie Elizabeth Foster) friend’s (Fitzroy Avery Vacker) home. Now time for my story of wonderful magic!!!”</p>
        
        <h3>Chapter 1</h3>
        <p>“Can you believe I passed midterm, Baina? I was soooo so so so close to failing Foxfire this year!”</p>
        <p>Foxfire. The only noble school in Everglean. The wonderful world of magic! Midterm was one of the many celebrations in Foxfire. Basically, you take a test and if you pass, you stay, and your friends get you a gift! Marella was one of the students there. So was her best friend, Baina.</p>
        <p>“I think you definitely deserve to stay at Foxfire!” Baina said.</p>
        <p>They went to their usual table where they met their friends Dex Dizznee, Sophie Foster, Keefe Sencen, Tam and Lihn Song, and Baina’s brother, Fitz Vacker.</p>
        <p>“Hello,” they all said.</p>
        <p>“So. Do any of you have anything to share about Elenor or Ethan?” Sophie said. “Me and Fitz have been working to search Keefe’s memories… and so far… we only found out that Avlar was the one that was supposed to deliver the message. And DON’T look at us like that, Fitz! So… Anyone?”</p>
        
        <p>No one looked surprised when Marella was the only one that raised her hand up. “I… um. Got Fintan to tell me a little more about them and the only thing he told me was…” Marella said nervously, fidgeting with her cape.</p>
        <p>“Tell us,” Sophie said. “It’s okay if it’s just a small thing.”</p>
        <p>“Well…” Marella said, “While I was training with Fintan, I asked him about it and he only said that the Neverseen had absolutely nothing to do with Ethan and-”</p>
        <p>“Wait a minute!” Keefe said, waving his hand in the air. “I thought you said it was just a small piece of information!!!”</p>
        <p>“It is only a small piece of information!!” Marella said.</p>
        <p>“For me it’s a huge piece of information! Do you have any idea how much time I’ve been blaming myself for their death?” Keefe asked.</p>
        <p>“Okay you two. Keefe’s right. It is a big piece of info. No more arguing. Okay?” Sophie interrupted before Marella could argue.</p>
        <p>“Fine,” Marella and Keefe said in unison and in a sarcastic way.</p>
        <p>“Good! Now let's get to work!” Sophie said. “I got some assignments for all of you. Dex, you work on making something to hack human registry. Tam, you scan London for any shadows around. Lihn, you check the water. Baina, you search London. And me, and Fitz will search Keefe’s memories… again. Everyone got it?”</p>
